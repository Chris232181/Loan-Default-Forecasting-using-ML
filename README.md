# Project-3
## Credit Risk Forecasting

This Project plans to evaluated two machine learning models in their accuracy to forecast defaults and furhter expected probability of defaults. The models that are being analysed are Logistic regression and XGBooster.
We are using a random loant tape with approximately 30k loans.
Steps:
1. Cleaning and preparation of loan tape
2. Split the data into training and testing data subsets. 60% training, 40% testing
3. Train the models and predict probabiltities of default for each ML model
4. Assess accuracy of both models using accuracy score, AUC score or ROC curve
5. Evaluate models and conclude on the most accurate model
